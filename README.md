# React Example

This is a very basic non-stylized version of the "City/Temp/Condition" (surrounding.vue) screen from [retro-env-can-weather-chan](https://github.com/Forceh91/retro-env-can-weather-chan) in React (+ TypeScript).

No data is fetched, a hardcoded list of weather stations are provided and it displays them in the same format as the original project does.

Data was taken from the 10 PM CST NOV 12/22 report.
